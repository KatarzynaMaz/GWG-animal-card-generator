# GWG-animal-card-generator

Welcome to the **GWG Animal Card Generator** project.

We will be creating a platform that allows for animal information to be input to automatically create an animal card, and create a collection of animal cards. The cards will not be able to be saved on the site, since this is a front-end course, but will populate new cards until the broswer is refreshed.

The goal of this project is to put our new skills to work. This project should give us a good grasp of the power in CSS classes, along with excercise our JavaScript/jQuery muscles!
